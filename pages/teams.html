                    NFL cuts tracker 2022: Roster updates for all 32 teams.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2022 NFL season will kick off a week from Thursday as the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams host the Buffalo Bills (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC) -- which means teams are cutting their rosters in preparation.

                    Teams were required to cut to 53 players by 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Cuts came earlier as teams finished their three preseason games on Sunday to accommodate the 17-game regular-season schedule.

                    Of the cuts, wide receiver Josh Gordon (Chiefs), running back Marlon Mack (Texans) and quarterback Kellen Mond (Vikings) are among the biggest names. Miami Dolphins cornerback Byron Jones and Buffalo Bills cornerback Tre'Davious White were placed on the PUP (physically unable to perform) list and both will miss a minimum of four games. Players starting the season on the PUP list don't count against the 53-man roster cap. Indianapolis Colts activated linebacker Shaquille Leonard off of the PUP list today, giving hope of a soon return.

                    There have also been multiple trades made this week as teams look to make room or bolster their roster. Follow along on our preseason trade tracker for those moves.

                    We tracked the biggest moves across the league and compiled each roster cut here.
