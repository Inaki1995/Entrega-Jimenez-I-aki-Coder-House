            <P>The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league that consists of 32 teams, divided equally between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC).<br>
                The NFL is one of the major North American professional sports leagues and the highest professional level of American football in the world. Each NFL season begins with a three-week preseason in August, followed by the 18-week regular season which runs from early September to early January, with each team playing 17 games and having one bye week.<br>
                Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference (four division winners and three wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament that culminates in the Super Bowl, which is contested in February and is played between the AFC and NFC conference champions. The league is headquartered in New York City.<br>
                The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966.<br>
                Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the rival American Football League (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970. The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States.<br>
                The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world, with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015. The NFL is the wealthiest professional sports league by revenue and the sports league with the most valuable teams.

                <h2>NFL Rank 2022: Predicting the top 100 players, with stats, notes and quotes for the league's best</h2>
                <p class="texto2">The 2022 NFL season kicks off Thursday, Sept. 8, and that means it's time for our annual ranking of the league's top 100 players. What can we expect from the game's best this season, and how do they stack up against each other?<br>

                    To create our list, we asked an ESPN panel of more than 50 NFL experts to rate players based on how good they will be in the 2022 season compared with their peers. Emphasis was placed solely on expectations for the upcoming season and predicting potential greatness, rather than past performance, career résumé or positional value. That means long-term injuries and suspensions played a part. From those ratings, we were able to rank the best of the best, one to 100.<br>
                    
                    The Los Angeles Chargers lead this year with eight players on this list. Twenty-seven franchises are represented, while five are absent: the New York Jets, New York Giants, Jacksonville Jaguars, Detroit Lions and, perhaps most surprising, the New England Patriots. Two-thirds of last year's top 100 returned for another appearance, and in terms of positions, wide receiver dominated -- again -- with 18 wideouts making the list. Quarterbacks (14) were also well represented.
                    
                    Last year, Todd McShay predicted four rookies would make the list in 2022 -- Kyle Pitts, Micah Parsons, Ja'Marr Chase and Jaylen Waddle -- and all of them are featured below.
                    
                    For each player, our NFL Nation reporters weighed in on his 2022 outlook and asked a player, coach or executive from the league what makes him so dominant. ESPN Stats & Information then provided a signature statistic to know, and fantasy analyst Mike Clay projected a stat line for this upcoming season.
                    
                    Here's the full list, starting with the Chiefs' star signal-caller, who's on top for a third straight season.</p>
